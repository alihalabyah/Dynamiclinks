# elgentos Dynamiclinks

This module will dynamically show upsell products based on the previous set of products they have seen in the category view. 

For example; a customer is on the Television category page and filters based on screen size. The customer will then click on one of the products. The upsell products shown are based on the previous set of televisions they saw; X above and Y below the current products' position (or price, or any other custom attribute).
